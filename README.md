# HPV Transmission and Vaccination Simulation in MSM
Simulation code for HPV transmission and vaccination in MSM using a dual-layer sexual network. It models long-term infection dynamics, evaluates vaccination scenarios, estimates infection rates and herd effects, and includes an MCMC-based module to calibrate transmission and clearance rates.

## Overview
This repository contains simulation code for modeling HPV transmission and vaccination strategies among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. The model employs a **dual-layer sexual contact network** capturing both same-sex and heterosexual contacts, simulates long-term infection dynamics, and evaluates the impact of different vaccination scenarios.  

It can estimate infection rates, indirect herd immunity effects, and inform national HPV vaccination policy. Additionally, the code includes a **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter calibration module** to optimize transmission probabilities and clearance rates, ensuring realistic epidemic dynamics.

## Features
- Dual-layer sexual network: MSM layer and heterosexual female/male layer.
- Long-term infection dynamics simulation.
- Vaccination strategy evaluation (coverage, timing).
- Estimation of infection rates and indirect protection effects.
- MCMC-based parameter calibration for transmission and clearance probabilities.
